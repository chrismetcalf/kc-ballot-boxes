Just a simple mobile-friendly app I created for the 2011 [Open Gov West Cross-Gov Apps Contest](http://www.opengovwest.org/events/conference/opengovwest-11/1304-2/).

It's a simple way to find your closest [KC Elections Ballot Drop Box](http://www.datakc.org/Elections/King-County-Elections-Ballot-Drop-Boxes/bjd8-qrep). It uses your device's GPS to find your location, then looks up the closest ballot boxes using the [Socrata Open Data API](http://dev.socrata.com). It also provides an easy way for you to text message that location to yourself using [SMSify](http://www.smsify.com).

Caveats:

* On the iPhone 4 Retina screen, the formatting is far too tiny. :)
* I wish there was a better way of getting the user's cell phone without having
  them type it

## Config ##
